    <h3>Neuroplasticity, what is it?</h3>
    <p>
    Well if we break the words in to two, 'Neuro' and 'Plasticity'. <br>
    Neuro meaning nerves in reference to the brain. 
    And plasticity in reference to the fact that plastic has many forms it can take. <br>
    <br>
    There is also principles to it. These are made by Kleim and Jones<br>
    There are principles to neuroplasticity are:
    <ol>
        <li>Use it or lose it</li>
        <li>Use it and Improve it</li>
        <li>Specificity</li>
        <li>Repitition Matters</li>
        <li>Intensity Matters</li>
        <li>Time Matters</li>
        <li>Age Matters</li>
        <li>Salience Matters</li>
        <li>Age Matters</li>
        <li>Transference or Generalization</li>
        <!-- <li>Interference</li> -->
    </ol>
    How can you use neuroplasticity principles to your benefit?<br>
    Neuroplasticity is something that requires a balancing act. Ranging from morning rituals, environment conditions, and some cases beverages.<br>
    This also applies the learning frequency and intensity to the learning. Some people call neuroplasticity a muscle that needs to be worked out. <br>
    The more you flex the muscle, the more you can use it and the heavier the strain you can handle.   
    <br>
    The idea behind the word is to be flexible and learn new skills. Adaptive being the word of choice here.<br>
    <br>
    What are some ways to increase neuroplasticity?<br>
    Unfortunately I don't think you can 'increase' neuroplasticity. More rather train it, improving it. And for that I can answer. <br>
    Neuroplasticity can be improved in a few ways, for example you can leave your comfort zone. Try things you never thought.<br>
    Arachnophobia? Try hold that harmless spider. Afraid of heights? Drone VR and look down. I understand these are extreme ways, and phobia has it's ranges. <br>
    There are also less extreme ways. Going to meetups, and speaking to complete strangers. Try that meal that piqued your curiosity. <br>
    Another way of improving your neuroplasticity, is to do things repetitively. And slightly more intense than the last time. <br>

    <h3>What is the Growth Mindset?</h3>
    <p>
    The growth mindset is perspective on learning. Instead of "I did it!" it's "I did it, but how can I do better"<br>
    And why is it relevant? Well imagine this: Your doing a task that is slightly above your skill level. Learning all sorts of solutions, yet struggle to implement them. <br>
    After so many errors and frustrations from just almost having it, it is natural to give up. "I failed to achieve this" is some peoples train of thought. Instead of that,<br>
    you can think "I have yet to achieve this.". Instead of putting yourself on the ground, you just state the fact that the goal has yet to be achieved, instead of outright declaring failure.<br>
    <br>
    Did anything surprise me in this exploration? Changes for me? <br>
    No, it didn't surprise me. It is relatively difficult to change your initial thought process. Instead declaring failure on unsuccessful attempts, to declare that you have yet to be there.<br>
    A negative, to a neutral yet positive stance on things. <br>
    I have no idea on how to integrate this into my learning journey. To fundamentally change the initial is challenging, and outright difficult to achieve. Don't get me wrong, it's not impossible either.<br>
    I did change my though process before to be more honest than I was before. I need to be consciously aware of what I am doing and rectify the initial response to "I can do this".
    Basically changing the response from not achieving a desired outcome. <br>
    <br>
    I didn't find anything particularly engaging to read for this part. Instead as a growth mindset is kinda habitual I will instead link a video on habits.<br>

    Knowing what neuroplasticity and the growth mindset, as well as how to incorporate them into your day to day life is important. This grants you the ability from being merely good at what you do to great.<br>
    Pushing yourself to try and explore what your curiosity is intrigued by. Or have your wonder lead to another thing. To be comfortable in the uncomfortable. <br>
