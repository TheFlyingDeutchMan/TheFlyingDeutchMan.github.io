    <h3>Problem solving</h3>
    <p>
    Imagine you have a list you want to sort. This list you want to separate things from one another. I was tasked with a problem requiring that to be solved.<br>
    I solved it by trial and error. There was no inherent techniques I used to solve it. I guess trying to build it piece by piece. Like the loop and the sorting system. <br>
    I learned the method to sort things. And googling<br>
    <br>
    There was no problem I solved elegantly. I just looked at the problem and just tried a bunch of things till it worked. And getting better at using the right tools. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    How confidant am I at using each problem solving techniques/methods?

        <li>3</li>
    </ol>
    A mix all round.

    I am often reluctant to ask others for help as I am not fond of sharing my problems with others. Yet eager to help others with theirs.
