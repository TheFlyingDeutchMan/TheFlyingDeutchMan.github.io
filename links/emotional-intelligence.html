    <h3>My understanding on it</h3>
    
    <p>My understanding of emotional intelligence is that it is the capability to understand and or relate to emotions.<br>
    In my case as I lack empathy, I understand from where people come from -- I many not know for how they feel, but in the least I understand them. <br>
    Emotional intelligence is also the ability to read peoples expressions and emotions that they have written on their face. A frown can mean distrust, or annoyance <br>
    A smile can be simple joy or general happiness. A face scrunched up, can be confusion or disgust. <br>
    <br>
    There are many things that surrounds emotional intelligence, this is what I know and understand of what we call is emotional intelligence.</p>
