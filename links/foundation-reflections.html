    <strong>What are 3 new things I have learned about myself and ego due to the Human Skills?</strong><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Too prideful</li>
        <li>Motivation issues still exist</li>
        <li>Still ever so afraid of failing</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br>
    The role of the values, empathy and self awareness are:
    <ul>
        <li>Empathy: Allows you to understand how other people feel and connect with them. This allows you to further help one another in times of need.</li>
        <li>Self-awareness: The ability to look in oneself, and reflect on performance, state of mind, impact and more. <br>
            This is the ruling stick some people measure themselves by, as well as beat themselves up with it</li>
    </ul><br>
    <strong>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</strong><br>
    How incredibly lacking I am. Living in a cycle of fearing failing, of which leads to me giving up, and thus failing.<br>
    <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the Humans Skills learning?</strong><br>
    Implementing some lacking parts to myself and character. I need to accept that I am still new to programming despite me already having prior experience. <br>
    Don't get me wrong it's easy to understand the material, but to put it with your routine, and integrating it apart of your day to day life feels like it shouldn't be that hard. <br>
    Deceivingly simple in thought. And practice shows you otherwise.<br><br>
    <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp Course?</strong><br>
    This gives us the ability to understand our struggles better, how  to assess it, and go on through it. This grants us the ability to grow ourselves from a good programmer to a great one. <br>
    That extra mile.<br><br>
    <strong>Does the time you spent studying Humans Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong><br>
    It doesn't feel like a waste of time. Even if you knew the material before hand, I still feel as if going through it again can help to a revelation to yourself and learning. To have it click. <br>
    I think having the knowledge on it and how to have the empathy to help others and assess when they're struggling.<br>
    As well as having the awareness that you also maybe struggling with your own set of challenges.<br>
