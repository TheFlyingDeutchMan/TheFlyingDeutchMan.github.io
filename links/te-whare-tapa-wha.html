    <h3>Wellbeing plan</h3>
    
    <p>
    For family wellbeing, talk with them, and help them with chores. <br>
    For mental wellbeing, going outside and chatting with friends. <br>
    For spiritual wellbeing, petting the cat. Soothes the soul. <br>
    For physical wellbeing, walking to the fridge. In all seriousness, probably do some rowing. <br>
