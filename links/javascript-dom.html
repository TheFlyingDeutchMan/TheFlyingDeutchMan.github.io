    <h3>To the non-tech friend of ours</h3>
    
    <p>
    Disclaimer to what I mean by non-tech: <br>
    Those that are really unfamiliar to the intricacies to technology, and are struggling to understand it. <br>
    This will be written out in laymen's terms, for easier understanding and digestion of the information given. <br>
    <br>
    Javascript's relation to CSS and HTML is like the wiring to a machine, connects and powers functions in a more streamlined manner. <br>
    Where as the HTML is like the frame the wiring is built to power. <br>
    And the CSS is the design of the guts and what is on display. The coat of paint that makes it look cool.
    <br>
    <br>
    Control flow, and loops are kinda like this: <br>
    Control flow is like following an order of steps, like following a recipe. <br>
    While loops are doing tasks repetitively until the task is done, kinda like cleaning your room till it's clean.<br>
    <br>
    DOM is what makes a static webpage into something dynamic, alive even. <br>
    A way a person can interact with the DOM is for example hitting the like button on a video, this adds a +1 to the engagement number. <br>
    Or seeing a photo someone posted, and commenting on it. This creates a new box of strings that a comprised of characters you put in! <br>
    DOM is what allows pages to react live.<br>
    <br>
    The difference between an array and a object is kinda like this:<br>
    An array is like a shopping list
    <ol>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Chocolate...</li>
    </ol>
    Now instead of counting normally, the computer starts it's count from 0. For example in the list above it'd be:
    <ol>
        <li>0</li>
        <li>1</li>
    </ol>
    For the maths it's easy as x-1. Nothing too fancy just the way the computer counts. Important to remember. <br>
    So if you want the first item you'd request the 0th item which is the first for us.<br>

    And for objects, imagine a form. This form has information like:
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Date of Birth</li>
        <li>Country of Birth</li>
        <li>Region</li>
    </ul>
    Often containing more or less depending on the type of form filled out. <br>
    To request the information, often at times you'd request the name of the person, <br>
    with Age or Date of birth as a quick security question. Though at times with a Unique Identifier <br>
    for added security.<br>
    <br>
    Functions are really useful, you create a tool for your toolbox. Need to have a random number generator?<br>
    You can just make it! and if you need to use it later you can just call it again. Being in use for the task at hand!<br>
    This gives you the ability to code more dynamically in the future.
