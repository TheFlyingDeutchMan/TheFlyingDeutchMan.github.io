    <h1>Tim's Learning Plan</h1>
    <div>
      <a href="../index.html">Home</a>

    <h3 class="centered-text">The Plan</h3>
    <p>I have ordered my way of learning in steps, including the rituals prior to learning. <br></p>
    <h4>The Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      Morning Ritual  
      <li>Wake up</li>
      <li>Breakfast</li>
      <li>Prep Stim Drinks (energy drinks)</li>
      <li>Queue loud music</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>
      if problem:
        break-down
        ...
        wait break-down = break-down-complete:
          understand
          ...
          wait understand = understood:
            end

      else:
        continue
      <!-- #TODO Make this not look ugly and appaling to look at! -->
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      At the end I was hindering myself. Lack of motivation, and unwillingness to continue.<br>
      The momentum I had, died. And I need to get the ball rolling. New routine, new ritual to learn. And at the top of that. Now I am in the thick of it.<br><br>
      
      <strong>So what will my long term plan be?</strong> <br>
      I am planning on using my skills to land me a simple entry level position in a job. <br>
      To further cement my skills and set them in stone. Instead of quasi-knowing something.<br>
      My goal after all of this and that. I don't know. Right now I would enjoy creating a simple game leading into my dream game. Game development simply. <br>
      Though I feel like in the end I want to have a role that requires me to be creative, whilst being logical about it. Varying each time.<br>
      <br>
      <strong> would be my greatest strength, and limitations in Bootcamp?</strong><br>
      I think I am really good at delivering ideas.<br>
      However in the same time I would struggle to be motivated judging how I am at the moment, as well as difficulty delivering that idea. <br>
      <br>
     <strong> What would be my greatest non technical challenge be in Bootcamp?<br></strong>
      I think my greatest non technical challenge would be is the fact that I struggle to recollect some parts I have learned. Quasi-knowing something. <br>
      Though I am confident that I can over come that through out the course.<br>
      <br>
     <strong> What non-technical skills would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br>
      I think getting myself organized and being more focused is something. Though organized is more likely that me being focused. <br>
      I also want end off the course in knowing the thing instead of quasi-knowing it.<br>
      <br>
      What are my expectations of myself for Bootcamp?<br>
      <ol>
        <li>To be organized</li>
        <li>Be on grounds at least once a week</li>
        <li>To contribute and be a effective teamplayer</li>
        <li>110% like the course you did before</li>
      </ol> 
    </p>
